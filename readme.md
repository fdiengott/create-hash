# create-hash

This is a simple proof of concept for creating a quick command-line package. This was created to just quickly hash and/or salt a provided password.

## Usage

```bash
> create-hash <password>
Do you want a salted password? (Y/n):
```

For this package to work properly it will need to be published or symlinked (meaning running `npm link` in the package directory).
